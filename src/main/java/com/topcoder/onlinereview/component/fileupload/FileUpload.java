/**
 * <p>
 * A class abstracting the parsing of <code>ServletRequest</code> to produce the <code>FileUploadResult</code>. The
 * information parsed in the <code>ServletRequest</code> includes uploaded files and form parameters. Implementations
 * should define the strategy to store the uploaded files to persistence (e.g. in memory or some kind of persistent
 * storage).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The uploaded file can be retrieved later (e.g. after restarting the application) using a file id. The file id should
 * be unique to every uploaded file. Implementations should also define how to assign this file id if applicable.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class should be initialized from a configuration namespace which should be preloaded. It will look for the
 * following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * single_file_limit (optional) - the single file size limit for each uploaded file in the request, in bytes. A value
 * of -1 indicates no limit. Default value is -1.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * total_file_limit (optional) - the total file size limit for all uploaded files in the request, in bytes. A value of
 * -1 indicates no limit. Default value is -1.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety: </b> This class is thread-safe by being immutable. Its implementations should also be thread-safe
 * (to be used in the servlet environment).
 * </p>
