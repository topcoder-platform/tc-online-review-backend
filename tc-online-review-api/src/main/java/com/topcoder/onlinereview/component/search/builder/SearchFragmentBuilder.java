 * will correspond to one or more of the Search Builder Filters. Adding filters
 * may entail adding additional SearchFragmentBuilders, and adding a new type of
 * datastore may require creating a new family of SearchFragmentBuilders.

 * <p>
 * Thread Safety: Implementations are required to be thread safe. All necessary
 * state can be maintained within the SearchContext.

     * <li> If the filter is a simple (atomic) filter, then the implementation
     * will modify the SearchContext in order to reflect the type and contents
     * of the provided filter. </li>

     *            filtering, and optionally to hold a mapping of fragment
     *            ubilders to delegate to.
