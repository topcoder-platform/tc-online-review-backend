/**
 * <p>
 * This class is a container for validation result returned by canStart() and canEnd() methods of PhaseManager and
 * canPerform() method of PhaseHandler. It contains not only a boolean value indicating whether the requested operation
 * can be performed or not, but additionally a message indicating why the operation cannot be performed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of PhaseManager and PhaseHandler should follow the following rules to make the code clearer:
 * <ol>
 * <li>OperationCheckResult.SUCCESS should be returned by canXXX() methods to indicate that operation can be performed
 * for the given phase;</li>
 * <li>new OperationCheckResult(&lt;&lt;explanation&gt;&gt;) should be returned by canXXX() methods to indicate that
 * operation cannot be performed for the phase and to provide a valid reasoning.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread Safety: This class is immutable and thread safe.
 * </p>
