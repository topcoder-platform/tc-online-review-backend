/**
 * <p>
 * Container class for all data associated to an exception within this component -
 * such as error/module codes, creation information, a logging flag and
 * unrestricted key/value pairs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When first created, each data instance is filled with default values, and the
 * thread name and creation date are set to their current values. The remaining
 * members all have setXXX methods, which all return the 'this' instance to
 * allow the data to be populated on a single line. Each member also has a
 * getXXX method for access.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread safety</b>: This class is not thread safe - the get/set methods
 * allow for concurrent access and modification. In their intended usage
 * patterns (within exceptions being thrown on single threads) this is not an
 * issue, but if thread safety is a concern later, it must be provided by a
 * handling class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Serialization</b>: To allow the exceptions to be serializable, this class
 * must also implement the serializable interface. All members are serializable,
 * except the map if it contains key or value objects which cannot be serialized -
 * these should be avoided if serialization is required.
