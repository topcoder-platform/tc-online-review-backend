/**
 * <p>
 * Optional, pluggable phase handling mechanism that can be configured per phase type/operation. The handler will
 * provide the decision of whether the start or end operation can be performed as well as extra logic when the phase is
 * starting or ending. Notice that the status and timestamp persistence is still handled by the component. When a user
 * wants a phase to be changed, the manager will check if a handler for that phase (i.e. for that PhaseType and for the
 * operation being done such as START or END a phase) exists and will then use the handler to make decisions about what
 * to do, as well as use the handler for additional work if phase can be changed
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We have the following invocation scenarios from a PhaseManager implementation with reference to phase handlers:
 * <ol>
 * <li>PhaseManager.canStart() - if a handler exists in the registry then the manager invokes the handler's
 * canPerform() method to see if we can change phase (i.e. start a new phase) and if yes, then we use perform
 * handler.perform() for any additional tasks to be performed.</li>
 * <li>PhaseManager.canEnd() - if a handler exists in the registry then the manager invokes the handler's canPerform()
 * method to see if we can change phase (i.e. end current phase) and if yes, then we use perform handler.perform() for
 * any additional tasks to be performed.</li>
 * <li>PhaseManager.start() - if a handler exists call handler.perform() before performing the associated persistence
 * operations</li>
 * <li>PhaseManager.end() - if a handler exists call handler.perform() before performing the associated persistence
 * operations</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Changes in 1.1:
 * <ol>
 * <li>canPerform() method was updated to return not only true/false value, but additionally an explanation message in
 * case if operation cannot be performed</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread Safety: Implementations of this interface are not required to be thread safe.
