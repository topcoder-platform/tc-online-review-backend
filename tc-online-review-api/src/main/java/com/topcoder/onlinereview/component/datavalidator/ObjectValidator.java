/**
 * <p>
 * This is the main contract for object validation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here we have the ability for simple validation (true/false) which will tell us if the object input is valid or not.
 * We also have the ability to specify a validation that will produce a message if the validation fails telling us
 * something about the cause. For complex validation where we could have multiple failure points we have the ability
 * to fetch all the messages that come from the validators that failed the object. This can further be refined into a
 * short-circuited evaluation or the non-short-circuted evaluation. In short-circuited evaluation we have a scenario
 * where the validator will return a failed result (with associated) messages, the moment it can determine that the
 * validation has failed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For example and <code>AndValidator</code> need only fail the first of its constituent validators to know that the
 * whole validation fails. Thus there is no need to invoke any further validators in the tree. Thus we have
 * short-circuited <code>AndValidators</code> for failure. The same way the <code>OrValidator</code> is
 * short-circuited for success. In non-short-circuted evaluation we keep on traversing the validator tree regardless
 * of the fact that the composite outcome is already determined. This is good for situations where we would like to
 * return to the user as much as possible information so that they can correct the issues as in a web page input for
 * example. There is also a variation on this with being able to limit the number of messages that are returned to the
 * caller so as to put an upper limit on the validator tree traversal.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> Implementations of this interface are required to be thread-safe.
