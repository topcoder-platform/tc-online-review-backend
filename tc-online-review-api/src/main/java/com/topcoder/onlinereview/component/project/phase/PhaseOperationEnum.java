/**
 * <p>
 * A convenient enumeration of phase operations as defined by the Phase Manager API which currently allows operations
 * of "start" and "end". This is provided as a utility to the user when they need to identify the phase
 * operation when registering a phase handler with a manager. This is used when creating HandlerRegistryInfo instances
 * for handler registrations (used as keys to id handlers), which need to know what operation the handler will handle
 * (as well as which phase status it will deal with - which is covered by PhaseStatusEnum).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Changes in 1.1:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Made this class a Java enum instead of extending Enum from Type Safe Enum component.</li>
 * <li>Removed CANCEL enum value.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread Safety: This class is immutable and thread safe.
