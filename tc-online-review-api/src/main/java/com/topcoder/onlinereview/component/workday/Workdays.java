/**
 * <p>
 * The Workdays Interface provides a set of generic functions to define a workday schedule (set holidays and other
 * non-work days, set whether or not weekend days are to be included as a normal workday, set the start and end hours
 * and minutes of a work day: for example, work day starts at 8:00AM and ends at 5:30PM) and a function to add days,
 * hours or minutes to an existing date and return the date that specifies how many work days it would take to
 * complete).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Implementations of this interface are not required to be thread safe.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong> Change log:</strong> Added generic parameters for Java collection types as a part of code upgrade from Java
 * 1.4 to Java 1.5. Add() method should allow negative amount arguments.
